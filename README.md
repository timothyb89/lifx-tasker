lifx-tasker
===========

Tasker plugin for controlling LIFX bulbs. Currently in an alpha state!

Does it work?
-------------

More or less! Right now it only has basic power control, but it won't be too difficult to expand on that (color, etc) in soon.

Things working:
 * Bulb control through dedicated app ("LIFX Tasker Plugin")
 * Bulb selection via Tasker
 * Basic power tasks (on/off/toggle) via tasks in Tasker

At the moment you'll need to build it yourself, but it should be up on the market (and posted here as an apk) within a couple of days.
