lifx-tasker
===========

A [Tasker](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/) plugin for controlling LIFX bulbs for Android 4.4 and up. Get it on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.timothyb89.lifx.tasker)!

What can it do?
---------------
Remember the [LIFX Kickstarter video](http://player.vimeo.com/video/77748502?autoplay=1)? Have you ever wished you could get all of the extra functionality they demonstrated, like notifications, alarms, and other automation? Wait no longer!

Here's some ideas to get you started:
* Make an "Instant Toggle" shortcut on your home screen
* Turn your lights on automatically when you get home
* Pulse your bulbs when you receive a notification
